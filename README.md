# DataSci
A collection of python classes and functions for automating pre-processing, visualization, and classification of generic data sets. Read the [docs](https://ekehoe32.github.io/DataSci/)!

## Installing the conda environment
In order to ensure proper behavior of python classes and functions between platforms we recommend installing an isolated conda environment with the depedencies listed in [environment.yml](environment.yml). To create a new enviroment with these dependencies, from the shell run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will generate the conda environment DataSci and install any dependencies required by the DataSci module.

## Installing the DataSci package
